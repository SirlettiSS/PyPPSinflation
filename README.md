# PyPPSinflation

 Python package to compute numerically and analytically scalar and tensor primordial power spectra (PPS) for single-field slow-roll inflationary models up to the third order. 


 PyPPSinflation is a simply and quick to use script devided into Jupyter Notebooks and Wolfram MAthematica notebooks. In particular it is devided as follow: 

1) Notebook 1 - Numerical PPS: in this notebook we solve the dynamical equations of the scalar field $\phi$, then, by setting the model of inflation with the potential $V(phi)$ we solve the scalar and tensor Mukhanov and Sasaki equation for the perturbations $\delta \phi$, which gives back the scalar and tensor primordial power spectra (PPS). From the PPS we compute numerically the spectral indices, their runnings, and the runnings of the runnings.

2) Notebook 2 - Quantities with respect to the number of $e$-fold $N$: this is a Wolfram Mathematica notebook where it is possibile to compute analytically all the quantities we need to compute the PPS analytically.

3) Notebook 3 - Analytical PPS: here we compute the analytical PPS at first, second and third order in $\ln\left(\frac{k}{k_*}\right)$. We compute analytically the spectral indices, their runnings, and the runnings of the runnings.

4) Notebook 4 - Analytical vs numerical PPS: here we make the comparisons among the analytical PPS up to the third order and the numerical PPS obtained in the first notebook. We also compare the spectral indices, their runnings, and the runnings of the runnings.

5) Notebook 5 - Plots: here we just make the notebook 4 shorter and we create the useful plots for the comparisons.
